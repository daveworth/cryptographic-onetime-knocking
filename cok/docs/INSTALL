System Requirements
-------------------
Java (tested with Sun JDK v1.4.1 & v1.4.2 under Gentoo and
         Apple's JDK 1.4.2 on OSX)

Ant (tested with v1.5.4 & 1.6.1)

jpcap (http://jpcap.sourceforge.net) v0.01.15

Installation
------------
Necessary Steps:
-1) Build JPCAP as per their instructions

 0) Unpack tarball of COK

 1) Copy the jpcap jar files (jpcap.jar jpcap-core.jar) and library
      (libjpcap.so or libjpcap.jnilib) )into <COKROOT>/lib

 2) In the root directory of the COK tree run %ant.  Ant will build all the 
      source files and move the libraries into <COKROOT>/build/jars/lib, 
      and place the 3 jar files it builds in <COKROOT>/build/jars

Optional Steps
 3) If you are running under OSX also run %ant ExportOSXApps, which
      will create two OSX Apps in <COKROOT>/build/Apps

 4) Configure <COKROOT>/lib/badPolicy to be a "good" policy for your
      site.  If you choose to rename badPolicy then you must edit
      <COKROOT>/scripts/runCOKd and change the policy file there.
      Another option for dealing with policies to install jpcap
      into ${java.home}/lib/ext, which by default gets
      java.security.AllPermission (according to my java.policy)

 5) If you plan on developing COK further you will likely want to run
      %ant docs to generate the javadoc for all of COKs packages
